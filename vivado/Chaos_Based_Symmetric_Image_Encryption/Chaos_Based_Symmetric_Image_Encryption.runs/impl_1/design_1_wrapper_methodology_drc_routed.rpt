TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT design_1_i/chaos_crypto_engine_0/inst/chaos_crypto_engine_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/crypto_engine_core_inst/u_prng/clock_gater_1/mul_block[0].mul_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-9#1 Advisory
BUFGCE with active CE has BUFG driver  
The BUFGCE cell design_1_i/chaos_crypto_engine_0/inst/chaos_crypto_engine_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/crypto_engine_core_inst/u_bufgce design_1_i/chaos_crypto_engine_0/inst/chaos_crypto_engine_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/crypto_engine_core_inst/u_bufgce/I pin (and CE is ACTIVE) is driven by BUFG_PS clock buffer design_1_i/zynq_ultra_ps_e_0/inst/buffer_pl_clk_0.PL_CLK_0_BUFG. Please review your clocking topology. If this cascaded clocking topology is desired to meet the clock enable timing requirements, then this methodology check can be waived. If this cascaded clocking topology is not desired, it should be reconnected in parallel to the driving clock buffer in order to reduce skew. Cascaded buffers introduce skew that can lead to difficult or impossible timing closure.

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 3 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
